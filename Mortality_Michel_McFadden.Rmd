<h5><b>Why Incident and Mortality Is Important :</b></h5>
Looking at Incident and Mortality is important because it can help predict the future of the state. To flatten the curve states want to keep their incident rates low over time. It may be possible to predict when states might open by looking at their incident rates and mortality rates. It's reasonable to assume that states that have low rates for both will open back up sooner than states with higher rates.

# A look at the heatmap values for the different cluster of states. 

* Cluster A is characterized by it's low testing, incident, and mortality rates and medium hospitalization rate.

* Cluster B is characterized by it's low hospitalization rate, medium testing and mortality rates, and high incident rate.

* Cluster C is characterized by it's low rates for all 4 features.

# What information can we get from looking at a biplot?
<h4><b> A biplot shows the characteristics of a cluster in relation to one another </b></h4>

* For example we see Cluster A's medium hospitalization rate characterized by the blue states plotted higher on the Hospitalization Rate eigenvector

* We can see Cluster B's high incident rate by the golden states with large placements on the Incident Rate eigenvector

* Cluster C's low values across all rates are demonstrated by it's clustering close to the origin of the biplot
