# Social Determinants of COVID-19 mortality in the United States
This is the data repository for publicly available code and data to reproduce analyses created by IDEA HEALTH INCITE @ RPI during the summer of 2020.

<b>Code: </b><br>
[`Prepossing.R`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/PM_COVID/Preprocessing.R) includes the code to extract all necessary data and prepocess data for statistical analyses.

[`Analyses.R`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/PM_COVID/Analyses.R) includes the code to implement negative binomial mixed models in primary, secondary and sensitivity analyses.

[`Figure.R`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/PM_COVID/PM_Notebook/*.Rmd) 
includes all relavent R Notebooks to be used for figure generation.


[`additional_preprocessing_code`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/PM_COVID/tree/master/additional_preprocessing_code) contains markdown files with code demonstrating the methodology we used to aggregate our zip code level data to the county level.


# Overview

Preprocessing --> Analysis --> Visualization

# Preprocessing.R

1. Read
2. Format (subset, rename, calculation)
3. Merge datasets on FIPS code
4. Save

```R
saveRDS(aggregate_chr_cdc_lung, file = 'Fixed_Date_Time_Series/06-28-2020data.Rds')
```


<b>Data: </b><br>
county_pm25.csv: the county-level PM2.5 exposure data averaged across the period 2000-2016 and averaged across grid cells in each county. For more source information see Additional Data Source section.

temp_seasonal_county.csv: the county-level seasonal temperature and relative humidity data, summer and winter averaged across the period 2000-2016 and averaged across grid cells in each county. For more source information see Additional Data Source section.

census_county_interpolated.csv: the county-level socioeconomic and demographic variables from 2012-2016 American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html).

county_base_mortality.txt, county_old_mortality.txt: additional county-level socioeconomic and demographic variables from 2009-2016 
US CDC Compressed Mortality Data (https://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-ICD10.html).

brfss_county_interpolated.csv: the county-level behavioral risk factor variables for 2011 US CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/).

statecode.csv: A map between state name and state abbreviations.

<b>Additional Data Source: </b><br>
The county-level PM2.5 exposure data can be created via PM2.5 predictions from The Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group at Dalhouse University (http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~atmos/martin/). Please visit the detailed instructions below

The seasonal temperature and relative humidity data can be created via 4km Ã— 4km temperature and relative humidity predictions from Gridmet via google earth engine (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/IDAHO_EPSCOR_GRIDMET).

We thank John Abatzoglou and members of the Climatology Lab at University of Idaho for providing the GRIDMET open-source datasets.
